# Unicorns Game

#### Have you ever dreamt being an unicorn that jumps on fake-clouds?
#### No?
#### However, now you can!

## How to install
### Step 1: 
You have to install SDL2. The tutorial is [here](https://github.com/alessandro-bugatti/vsgl2/blob/master/README.md)

In the same page, you'll find how to install vsgl2 library. It is not important to install it if you only want to try this game, but, if you want to code using graphic library you have to install it, learn from lessons and modify them. 
### Step 2: 
Install this game project.
As vsgl2 library, it can be done in two ways:
- Without using ```git```: download the zip file at the beginning of this page (```Clone or download button```), extract it wherever you want, open the file *.cpb using codeblocks, then run it and play
- Using ```git```: in this case you have to install ```git``` first, then write the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imaprincess/Unicorns-Game.git
```  

## How to play
Use left and right arrows to move the unicorn and make it jump on fake-clouds (they are rectangles, but that's not important).
You can change settings and use the mouse instead of arrows, but I **don't** advise it. 
There are various types of objects on blocks: some of them helps you, some of them doesn't. You have to play a lot to understand what objects are friendly and what aren't.

## Bugs
I know that my code is full of bugs, but I don't like playing this game, so I can't find them.
If you find a bug in the code, something strange appens when you play or other types of error (in this file, IE), please tell me!
