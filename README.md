# Unicorns Game

A pink game for unicorn lovers! 

## How to install
### Step 1: 
You have to install SDL2. The tutorial is [here](https://github.com/alessandro-bugatti/vsgl2/blob/master/README.md)

In the same page, you'll find how to install vsgl2 library. It is not important to install it if you only want to try this game, but, if you want to code using graphic library you have to install it, learn from lessons and modify them. 
### Step 2: 
Install this game project.
As vsgl2 library, it can be done in two ways:
- Without using ```git```: download the zip file at the beginning of this page (```Clone or download button```), extract it wherever you want
- Using ```git```: in this case you have to install ```git``` first, then write the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imaprincess/Unicorns-Game.git
```  
If you have codeblocks, you can open .cpb file and run the game directly there; 
if you haven't got it, there is a file inside the directory you have just downloaded that runs the game (I don't think it will work if you are using Windows!): 

```cd /your/directories/Unicorns-Game```

```./run.sh```

## How to play

This is the main page:

It will appear when you run the game. Here, you can:

- Play the game 
- Read the instructions
- Change some settings
- See the high scores (they are writed on a local file, sadly :c)

Use left and right arrows to move the unicorn and make it jump on fake-clouds (they are rectangles, but that's not important). Use the 'S' to fire the enemies.

You can change settings and use the mouse instead of arrows, but I **don't** advise it. 

There are various types of objects on blocks: some of them helps you, some of them doesn't. You have to play a lot to understand what objects are friendly and what aren't.

## How to contribute
There are several ways to contribute to this project:

- Play it! If you discover a bug, or if something unexpected happens, please tell me! 
- To insert your name for high scores, you have to write it in terminal - so obsolete! I'll fix it ASAP, in the meantime, if someone wants to do it... ðŸ˜˜
